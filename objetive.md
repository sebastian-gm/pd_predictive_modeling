# Project Objetive

I aim to develop a predictive model to estimate the probability that a loan applicant will default, using the German Credit dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. My goals include:

- Improving the baseline predictive accuracy (AUC-ROC) over a simple logistic regression model.
- Ensuring the final model is interpretable for stakeholders and regulators (e.g., using SHAP values).
- Adhering to ethical and regulatory standards, ensuring no protected groups are unfairly treated.

This project will utilize Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and well-documented code to ensure reproducibility and maintainability.
